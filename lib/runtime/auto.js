/*
 * greenTile — window tiling extension for Cinnamon
 * UUID: greenTile@carsteneu
 *
 * per-App auto-tiling observer: the per-monitor debounce timers, the fresh-
 * window pending sets, the monitor maps, the workspace/window observers and
 * the sort-rect overrides a resize or swap leaves for the next retile. Owned
 * by the App (monitors-changed destroys the App) and destroyed in the
 * autoDisconnectAll slot of Config.destroy, in the same order: timers
 * removed, maps cleared, drop.stop(), sort overrides cleared, exclusion
 * toggles cleared, workspaces disconnected, global signals disconnected,
 * tracked windows untracked.
 * The global signals are connected on the component's own runtime Scope (App
 * lifetime). The workspace window-added/removed handlers are dropped and
 * reconnected mid-life (notify::n-workspaces) and the per-monitor debounce
 * timers are replaced on reschedule — both keep explicit id lists / a timer
 * Map instead of the scope (no selective mid-life disconnect). Split, drop,
 * border and exclusion runtime comes in as injected deps. All Cinnamon access
 * is injected.

// A plain click on a title bar is a MOVING grab that ends exactly where it began:
// Cinnamon starts a move grab on every button press on a title bar, motion or not
// (verified live). Retiling the surface for it re-places every tile, and any small
// deviation of a window (a focus-driven shift, a size-increment rounding) then snaps
// back visibly — the "jumps a pixel on every click" report. The grabbed window's frame
// is therefore compared with a couple of pixels of slack, the same slack the drop
// module uses for its cancel test (#94937): this is only the click/drag distinction,
// a real drag moves the frame by far more.

// Cinnamon animates every workspace switch on the window ACTORS
// (/usr/share/cinnamon/js/ui/windowManager.js _switchWorkspace): at the switch it
// records each actor of the old and the new workspace as origX/origY, eases x/y for
// WORKSPACE_ANIMATION_TIME (150 ms) times the effect-speed multiplier (at most 1.4),
// and its cleanup ends with set_position(origX, origY). A frame greenTile moves inside
// that window is therefore undone on the actor: Muffin synced the actor to the new
// frame, the cleanup writes the position from BEFORE the switch back, and Muffin does
// not re-sync until the frame changes again. The frame is right while the window is
// drawn at its old place — the overlaps, empty cells and off-screen windows after a
// Super+Ctrl+Arrow push. A retile asked for while the effect runs is held until it
// ended, and not a frame longer: Cinnamon's handler runs before greenTile's (it is
// connected when the shell starts, windowManager.js constructor, before any extension)
// and creates every ease synchronously (/usr/share/cinnamon/js/ui/environment.js
// _easeActor reads the new transitions right after restore_easing_state), so when
// greenTile sees the switch the whole effect is already visible on the actors. No actor
// with the effect's origX mark and a live x/y ease means no effect: nothing is held.
// Otherwise the hold looks again every SWITCH_POLL_MS (about one frame) and ends at the
// first look after the cleanup removed the last mark; SWITCH_EFFECT_CAP_MS is the
// emergency brake if an effect never reports its end.

// client switching desktops in a loop) could keep tiling waiting for as long as it
// lasts. A hold that has lasted this long is not extended any more: the next look ends
// it. And a press flood inside one hold is bounded: beyond this many held presses the
// newest are dropped (and logged) instead of piling up for one burst of placements.
// The price of the total bound, accepted: a switch chain longer than this ends its hold
// at the running look's 1000 ms cap even if a later switch's effect still runs, so the
// held runs of that one chain may land inside an effect (the stale-actor case once per
// chain, which the actor resync in lib/runtime/actorsync.js may still repair).
