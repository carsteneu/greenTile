/*
 * greenTile — window tiling extension for Cinnamon
 * UUID: greenTile@carsteneu
 *
 * per-App placement-resource owner: the exact transitions greenTile started on
 * a window's compositor actor (lib/tiling/place.js parks translation/scale and
 * eases them back to identity). One record per window, keyed by the MetaWindow
 * and holding the actor it was read from — the window's
 * get_compositor_private() is already NULL by the time an App teardown runs
 * (Muffin queues the actor destroy first), so the actor cannot be re-resolved
 * later.
 *
 * Ownership is per transition object (actor.get_transition(name)), never per
 * property name. Each of our transitions carries its own 'stopped' handler
 * (environment.js connects exactly this signal: `transition.connect('stopped',
 * (t, finished) => ...)`), so:
 *   - a foreign animation that replaced one of our transitions is recognised by
 *     the transition IDENTITY and left completely alone — its transition is
 *     never removed and its value is never reset;
 *   - one cancelled property no longer drops the ownership of its siblings: the
 *     record survives, and each property is resolved on its own.
 * A property whose transition is gone is repaired only when it is provably
 * ours: our transition stopped unfinished, the actor never reported another
 * transition COMPLETING on that property afterwards, and the field still carries
 * the value it froze at. The middle condition is the actor's own detailed
 * ::transition-stopped signal (name, is_finished) — Muffin emits it from
 * on_transition_stopped when a transition finishes and from
 * clutter_actor_remove_transition when one is removed, both AFTER the
 * transition has left the actor's table (clutter-actor.c 19387-19391,
 * 19722-19770). Our own removal only ever reports is_finished=FALSE, so a TRUE
 * for a property whose entry we already saw stop can only come from a different
 * transition — a takeover. Numeric equality of the value is deliberately NOT
 * used as the proof: a foreign animation that supersedes ours and finishes on
 * exactly the value we froze leaves the same field value behind.
 *
 * Every identity write re-checks the property immediately before writing it: a
 * removal emits ::transition-stopped synchronously and a handler may chain a
 * replacement (that is what the "emitted after removal" invariant exists for),
 * and the assignment itself would cancel that replacement through the
 * duration-0 skip branch (clutter-actor.c 5420-5423, 4819, 19433-19436).
