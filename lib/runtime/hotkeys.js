/*
 * greenTile — window tiling extension for Cinnamon
 * UUID: greenTile@carsteneu
 *
 * per-App hotkey owner: registers the static 'greenTile-*' hotkeys on the
 * injected keybindingManager and removes exactly those 14 names idempotently.
 * register() always removes first, so a binding change arriving through
 * Config.registerHotkeys re-registers exactly once — WITHOUT touching the panel's
 * Escape hotkey, which the panel state owner binds and unbounds per open/close
 * (mid-life things keep explicit ids, learning #95219). Per-entry fault
 * tolerant: one failing removeHotKey must not skip the rest.
 * All Cinnamon access is injected (deps).
