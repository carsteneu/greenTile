/*
 * greenTile — window tiling extension for Cinnamon
 * UUID: greenTile@carsteneu
 *
 * Compositor-actor resync: a placement moves a window's FRAME rect, and Muffin syncs
 * the window's compositor actor to it. After rapid successive placements the actor of a
 * client-decorated (CSD, sync-request) window can stay stuck at an intermediate
 * position/size while the frame rect AND the X server are already correct — measured
 * live after a Super+Ctrl+Left push chain: the frame sat in cell 3 while the actor was
 * still drawn at cell 4, so cell 3 looked empty and the cell-4 window was covered.
 * greenTile's geometry was right; only the actor lagged.
 *
 * One verification per surface and placement, a short delay after the retile (see
 * ACTOR_SYNC_MS): every placed window's actor must keep the offset it had from its frame
 * before the placement. That relation needs no frame-extents API — Muffin exposes none
 * for the actor — and is the same for CSD and SSD windows, because whichever actor
 * Muffin draws, a placement must move it by exactly what the frame moved.
 *
 * On a mismatch the surface is nudged exactly once: a DIFFERENT rect (which is what
 * makes a stuck sync follow again) and then the target rect. Re-issuing the same rect is
 * a no-op in Muffin and would not repair anything — the live repair test showed a +1 px
 * move followed by the real rect puts the actor back. No loop, no retry: a stuck actor
 * that a nudge does not repair is left alone rather than fought. The log line reports
 * the nudge that was issued, not a re-read result.
 *
 * Deliberate blind spots. The relation is a DELTA, so a placement that re-issues the
 * same rect cannot expose an actor that was already stale before it — the check has no
 * fresh reference to compare against. A desync in SIZE alone is detected, but the
 * repair re-issues the position only: a 1 px size detour would make a terminal reflow
 * its character grid, which costs the user more than the lag does.
 *
 * A user's grab and a running position animation (the shell's workspace switch writes
 * actor.x/y) own the geometry: the check stands down while either is live instead of
 * fighting it, and misses that one repair.

// The actor follows a frame move asynchronously: Muffin moves it when the compositor
// processes the request, and a client-decorated window answers through its sync-request
// counter, so the offsets must be read after the compositor had its moment. 320 ms
// clears the placement ease (ANIMATE_MS 250 in lib/tiling/place.js) and is deliberately
// distinct from the auto observer's 300 ms debounce, so a following retile supersedes
// this check and timer-counting tests stay unambiguous. Short enough that a gap never
// becomes visible: the host's gap lasted minutes because nothing repaired it at all.
const ACTOR_SYNC_MS = 320;
// The actor rounds to whole pixels and a fractional-scale monitor can shift the frame by
// one: the offset is only compared with a few pixels of slack.
