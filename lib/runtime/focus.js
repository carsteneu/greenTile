/*
 * greenTile — window tiling extension for Cinnamon
 * UUID: greenTile@carsteneu
 *
 * per-App focus bindings: Super+Arrow moves the keyboard focus on
 * monitor+workspaces where automatic tiling is on. push-tile-* are Cinnamon's
 * own builtin wm keybindings (org.cinnamon.desktop.keybindings.wm), so both
 * module generations register through the generation's builtin surface:
 *
 *  - upstream (keybindingManager.setBuiltinHandler present and
 *    Meta.KeyBindingAction resolves the name): the manager route, so the
 *    shell's action-mode filter applies (default ActionMode.NORMAL — the
 *    hotkeys go quiet in overview/modal states) and the dispatcher entry is
 *    tracked for restore.
 *  - 6.6 / enum-less muffin (no setBuiltinHandler): the direct
 *    Meta.keybindings_set_custom_handler surface — mode filtering is not part
 *    of it.
 *
 * connect() records one registration per name BEFORE the acquisition call and
 * installs an own dispatcher that turns inert the moment destroy() starts, so
 * no failure anywhere in teardown can leave a live callback holding the
 * destroyed App.
 *
 * destroy() restores per registration, each in its own try, so one throwing
 * restore never strands the remaining names, and reports the combined failures
 * to the caller (Config.destroy logs them). What it does per failure is decided
 * by WHO owns the manager-visible slot right now, because that slot is a
 * singleton across App recreation — it is the rollback target the next App will
 * capture:
 *
 *  - slot is OURS and a prior is known: hand the prior back. If that handoff
 *    fails, the prior is written back into the slot itself before retrying, so
 *    the next App still recovers the real prior instead of our dead dispatcher.
 *  - slot is OURS and nothing was there before us: remove our entry and reset
 *    the Meta handler. The Meta reset is attempted even when the slot is
 *    already gone, otherwise our dispatcher keeps swallowing the key.
 *  - slot already holds our known prior: retry the handoff (idempotent).
 *  - slot belongs to a NEWER owner that registered after us: leave it alone —
 *    never restored over, never removed, never reset.
 *
 * A failed registration stays owned so a same-instance retry can complete it,
 * unless the slot was handed to a newer owner.
 *
 *  - direct Meta route restore target: only the names THIS instance overrode
 *    are reset to muffin's builtin. Meta.keybindings_set_custom_handler has no
 *    getter counterpart, so an unknown foreign direct handler that predated us
 *    cannot be discovered — a platform limitation, reported rather than papered
 *    over with an invented getter.
 *
 * Platform limits that no ownership bookkeeping can close (documented, not
 * papered over): the direct route exposes no ownership signal at all — no
 * readable handler and no manager map — so a handler registered there AFTER us
 * cannot be distinguished either, and destroy() necessarily resets the name to
 * muffin's builtin on that route. On the manager route, upstream's
 * setBuiltinHandler hands out a FRESH entry object per call, so ownership is
 * decided by that object's identity — not by callback identity, which cannot
 * tell a newer owner that reused the same callback with different allowedModes
 * from the prior we recorded. Upstream also stores `bindings: []`, so a prior
 * entry's configured accelerator array is not round-tripped; the restore hands
 * back the callback and allowedModes, which is what the delivery path reads.
