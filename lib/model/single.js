/**
 * What happens to a lone tiled window (setting singleWindowMode, a select):
 *
 * - 'leave'  the window is not placed at all.
 * - 'fill'   it fills the whole usable area (singleLayout).
 * - 'center' it is placed centered — golden-ratio width, 90 % height, equal
 *            margins (singleCenterLayout).
 *
 * singleMode normalises a stored value — anything that is not a known mode
 * reads as 'leave', so a corrupt or legacy value never tiles a lone window by
 * accident. singleActive is the n guard the tiling reads: only exactly one
 * window, and only off 'leave'. singleBase picks the layout for the active
 * mode (the fallback of 'fill' and of every unknown case is the full area).
 * @param {any} raw
 * @returns {'leave' | 'fill' | 'center'}

/**
 * The layout of a centered lone window. The window gap is deliberately NOT
 * subtracted on top of the golden margins — the margins dwarf any gap. The
 * layout therefore carries the centered frame OUTSET by the gap as its `area`:
 * the gap handling (lib/model/gap.js gapCell) subtracts that outset again, so the
 * placed frame is singleCenterRect. The cancellation needs the margins to exceed
 * half the gap, because gapCell insets a side only while it differs by 1 px or
 * more; in the narrow band just below that (usable height about ten times the gap
 * — 480 px at gap 48 — or a usable width under ~130 px) a side keeps its outset
 * and the window grows by up to the gap. Desktop sizes are exact.
 *
 * An application minimum larger than the frame is not overruled: the window then
 * grows from the frame's top-left corner, exactly like a full-area single window
 * that refuses to shrink. The fit machinery raises cell sizes, never re-centers a
 * refused frame, so a very large minimum can push the window off center.
 *
 * `area` also reaches the placement record (lib/tiling/place.js); re-applying a
 * stored manual split is guarded by splitValid, and no split can be stored for a
 * shape of one cell, so a lone window never re-applies one.
 * @param {Rect} area
 * @param {number} gap
