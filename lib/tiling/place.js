// Animated placement: the window gets its final geometry instantly (no stepped
// resizes — those reflow terminal text at every step), while the compositor actor
// is parked at the old rect via translation/scale and eased back to identity.
// Offsets are set BEFORE the move so no intermediate frame shows the final position.
//
// The shell's own size-change effect writes exactly these four properties too
// (windowManager.js _sizeChangedWindow, gated on windows with __animationInfo
// and on desktop-effects-change-size) and its done handler mass-cancels them.
// Two consequences the owner handles: (1) if that effect is ALREADY running on
// one of these properties, the placement skips its animation entirely — the
// platform cancels whatever sits on an eased property, and cancelling a foreign
// animation is forbidden; (2) if it starts while our ease runs, our transitions
// are cancelled and the record survives so its values are still repaired. The
// visible animation is the shell's in both cases.

// the ease targets and the per-App ownership table (the parked values are
// actor fields, the dashed `prop` is the Clutter transition name). 'offset'
// entries are absolute positions, 'ratio' entries are size factors; `axis`
// names the frame-rect member the property derives from. The tiling layer must
// not import the runtime layer, so the table is handed to the owner as an
// argument.
